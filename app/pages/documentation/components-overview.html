        # Packages & Components

        We have two seperate packages, core app-states library and user interface components.
        Both packages use the Polymer. Make sure you have [webcomponents.js](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/) and [polymer.html](https://www.polymer-project.org/) included in your page.

        ## app-states

        This is the core package. You can [download](https://github.com/Kalitte/app-states) or
        run `bower install app-states --save` to install.

        After installing you can import library components using app-states.html.

        ```html
        &lt;link rel=&quot;import&quot; href=&quot;bower_components/app-states/app-states.html&quot;&gt;
        ```

        app-states provides the following web components.

        | Web Component | Description
        | ------------- |:-------------
        | app-states     | Container component for application states.
        | app-state      | Use to declare an application state.

        | place-holder   | Similar to states-section except you can use it without section element.

        ## app-states-ui

        app-states-ui provides user interface components. These components can be considered as
        helper components to simplify application state management and are optional.

        You can [download](https://github.com/Kalitte/app-states-ui) or
        run `bower install app-states-ui --save` to install.

        After installing you can import library components using app-states-ui.html.

        &lt;link rel=&quot;import&quot; href=&quot;bower_components/app-states/app-states-ui.html&quot;&gt;
        ```
