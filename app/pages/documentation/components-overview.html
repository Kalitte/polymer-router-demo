        # Packages & Components

        We have two seperate packages, core app states library (app-states) and user interface components (app-states-ui).
        Since both packages have dependencies to Polymer make sure you have [webcomponents.js](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/) and [polymer.html](https://www.polymer-project.org/) included in your page.

        ## app-states

        This is the core package. You can [download](https://github.com/Kalitte/app-states) or
        run `bower install app-states --save` to install.

        After installing you can import library components using app-states.html.

        ```html
        &lt;link rel=&quot;import&quot; href=&quot;bower_components/app-states/app-states.html&quot;&gt;
        ```

        app-states provides the following web components.

        | Web Component | Description
        | ------------- |:-------------
        | app-states     | Container and manager component for application states.
        | app-state      | Use to declare an application state.
        | states-template| HTML template element modifier. Use to set content for a specific state.
        | states-section | HTML section element modifier. Use to declare updatable page sesction.
        | place-holder   | Similar to states-section except you can use it directly without section element.

        ## app-states-ui

        app-states-ui provides user interface components. These components are optional and can be
        considered as helper elements to simplify application development.

        You can [download](https://github.com/Kalitte/app-states-ui) or
        run `bower install app-states-ui --save` to install.

        After installing you can import library components using app-states-ui.html.

        ```html
        &lt;link rel=&quot;import&quot; href=&quot;bower_components/app-states/app-states-ui.html&quot;&gt;
        ```
        app-states-ui provides the following web components.

        | Web Component | Description
        | ------------- |:-------------
        | states-menu     | Uses core-menu and core-submenu component to create a dynamic menu using application states.
        | states-anchor   | HTML anchor modifier. Automatically sets href attribute of an anchor based on stateId arrtibute.
