        # Working with state manager

        State manager is represented by the app-states element. State manager is responsible for;

        - Keeping a list of available application states.
        - Listening to URL changes and matching the state corresponding to active url.
        - Providing helper methods, i.e. going to a state, getting a state by id etc.
        - If not provided, automatically creating url's based on id values of states.

        ## Getting state manager instance
        Every application should have only one state manager instance.
        The first instance will be the default instance.

        To get a reference to state manager instance use `window.AppStates.getInstance` method.

        ## Creating state manager
        To create a state manager use `app-states` element. Inside app-states just declare states using
        `app-state` element.

        ```html

        &lt;section id=&quot;nav&quot; is=&quot;states-section&quot;&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section id=&quot;page&quot; is=&quot;states-section&quot;&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;app-states&gt;
          &lt;app-state id=&quot;home&quot; url=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
            &lt;template target=&quot;#nav&quot; is=&quot;states-template&quot;&gt;
              &lt;!-- When url is / load this content into #nav --&gt;
            &lt;/template&gt;

            &lt;template target=&quot;#page&quot; is=&quot;states-template&quot;&gt;
              &lt;!-- When url is / load this content into #page --&gt;
            &lt;/template&gt;

            &lt;app-state id=&quot;login&quot;&gt;
              &lt;template target=&quot;#page&quot; is=&quot;states-template&quot;&gt;
                &lt;!-- When url is /login load this content into #page --&gt;
              &lt;/template&gt;
              &lt;!-- Inherit #nav content from home --&gt;
            &lt;/app-state&gt;
          &lt;/app-state&gt;
        &lt;/app-states&gt;
        ```
        ## Common usage scenarios

        This section summarizes common state manager methods you will probably need to use in your applications.

        ### Matching url value to a state

        Use `matchState` method to get a state instance for a given URL value.

        ```javascript
        Polymer.whenReady(function() {
          var instance = document.getElementById('stateManager');
          // or use AppStates.getInstance().matchState
          // or use AppStates.matchState

          var state = instance.matchState('#/login');
          console.log(state.id);
          // login
        });
        ```

        You can customize matching state process by adding an event handler for `state-match` event.

        ```javascript
        instance.addEventListener('state-match', function(e) {
          // e.detail.match holds the reference to matched state.
          // If you set a value state manager will use that value as state.
          // null value means a state is not matched.
        });
        ```
        ### Getting state reference by id

        Use `getStateById` method to get a reference to state identified by the `id` value.

        ```javascript
        var loginState = instance.getStateById('login');
        console.log(loginState.url);
        ```

        ### Changing browser URL

        Use `go` method to navigate to an url. `go` method changes the url of the browser so that url listener can navigate to
        a state. Please note this method is asynchronous and does not navigate to a state immidiately.

        ```javascript
        if (instance.currentState.id !== 'login')
          instance.go('/login');
        ```
        When url is changed;

        - `url-change` event is fired. This event is cancelable.
        - State manager calls `matchState` method and tries to get a valid state.
        - `state-changing` event is fired. This event is cancelable.
        - If a valid state is matched, state manager tries to load state.
        - After loading new state `state-changed` event is fired, oldState and currentState properties are updated.

        ### Getting root state

        Use `getRootState` method to get a reference to root state.
